#   It's OPTIONAL and could be anything specifying the area of the commit.
#   For example, 'frontend', 'backend', 'api', 'ci', 'l10n', ...

#
# <subject>
#   It contains a succinct description of the change
#   Capitalize the subject line
#   Don't exceed 50 chars in leght.

#   A footerâ€™s token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., "Reviewed-by: ", "Refs:"
#   The footer should contain any JIRA (or other tool) issue references and/or actions such as 'Closes #108'.
